			<p>Digital Fortress is a modern-day security tool for the Internet generation. Using the webcam on your computer and an Internet connection, Digital Fortress tracks movement around the webcam, audio, and the location of the device. All of these data is sent to the Digital Fortress site, allowing the user to access it in case the device is stolen.</p>

			</p>Digital Fortress is best used in addition to traditional security means. For example, a user may leave Digital Fortress running on his computer while the user is on vacation, taking pictures if anyone breaks into his house while away.</p>
				
			<p>Digital Fortress uses a combination of video, audio, and geolocation data in order to achieve its purpose. After logging in through your Google account, the tool will use your Web Camera and click pictures when it detects motion. These pictures are uploaded on the website and can be accessed through any machine.</p>

			<p>Digital Fortress was developed in the Spring of 2013 at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign by Nathan Hibner, Shugo Tanaka, Jatin Pandey, Lavanya Iyer, Aditya Jain and Brian Chen.</p>
