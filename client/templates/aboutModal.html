			<p> Digital Fortress is a tool that helps you to secure your device against theft while you are away.

				Digital Fortress can be used in case one finds the need to be away from the machine for a while but does not wish 
				to take one's machine with them. Digital Fortress will watch over your device, discourage potential theft and in  
				case theft does take place, provide valuable information that can be used to retrieve the device.
				
				Digital Fortress uses a combination of Audio/Video as well as Geolocation data in order to achieve this purpose. 
				After logging in through your Google account, the tool will use your Web Camera and click pictures when it detects
				motion. These pictures are uploaded on the website and can be accessed through any machine.

				Digital Fortress was developed in the Spring of 2013 at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign by 
				Nathan Hilbert, Shugo Tanaka, Jatin Pandey, Lavanya Iyer, Aditya Jain and Brian Chen.
